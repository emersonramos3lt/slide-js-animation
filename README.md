# Description

In this project, I developed an animated slideshow gallery, where each slide features dynamic animations for elements such as images and text that smoothly appear. 
I utilized DOM manipulation in JavaScript to enhance interactivity, creating a more engaging user experience. The page includes three different slides, each displaying 
a unique image along with its corresponding number and name.

# Main Features
- HTML and CSS
